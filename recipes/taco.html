  <img src="../img/taco.jpg"/>
  <p>A taco is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a tortilla, typically made of corn or wheat, filled with a variety of savory ingredients.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tortilla:</strong> The foundation of a taco, providing a vessel for the filling. It can be soft or hard-shelled. </li>
    <li><strong>Fillings:</strong> A wide array of options exist, including: MEat, Vegetables, Cheese and Sauces</li>
    <li><strong>Garnish:</strong> Fresh toppings that add flavor and texture, such as cilantro, onions, and lime wedges. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC (160ºC for fan assisted ovens), gas mark 4. Rub 1 1/2 tablespoon of the seasoning mix over the pork joint. Heat the oil in a medium heavy based casserole dish or ovenproof pan over a medium heat and add the pork. Cook for 3-4 minutes, turning so each side is browned. Remove and discard the string.</li>
    <li>Add the pineapple juice and water to the pan with the remaining seasoning mix, bring to the boil and turn down to a simmer, cover and cook in the oven for 3 hours until the pork is tender and falling apart.</li>
    <li>Drain the liquid from the pork reserving 50ml. Shred the pork, using 2 forks and stir together with the reserved liquid.</li>
    <li>Stir the rice, beans and most of the coriander together in a medium bowl. Mix the red onion, lime juice and salt together in a small bowl. Allow them to stand for 5 minutes to allow the flavours to infuse.</li>
    <li>Fill the soft tortillas with the rice, pulled pork, sliced pineapple, pickled red onions and garnish with the remaining coriander.</li>
  </ol>
