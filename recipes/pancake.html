  <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Flour:</strong> This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
    <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong> Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
    <li><strong>Milk and butter:</strong> Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Egg:</strong> A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
